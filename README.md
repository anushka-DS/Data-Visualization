 Data Visualization with Python
 
 
Data visualization is the discipline of trying to understand data by placing it in a visual context so that patterns, trends and correlations that might not otherwise be detected can be exposed.

Python offers multiple great graphing libraries that come packed with lots of different features. No matter if you want to create interactive, live or highly customized plots python has an excellent library for you.

To get a little overview here are a few popular plotting libraries:

**Matplotlib:** low level, provides lots of freedom

**Pandas Visualization:** easy to use interface, built on Matplotlib

**Seaborn:** high-level interface, great default styles

**ggplot:** based on Râ€™s ggplot2, uses Grammar of Graphics

**Plotly:** can create interactive plots


**Matplotlib** is the most popular python plotting library. It is a low-level library with a Matlab like interface which offers lots of freedom at the cost of having to write more code.

**Seaborn**
Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for creating attractive graphs.
Seaborn has a lot to offer. You can create graphs in one line that would take you multiple tens of lines in Matplotlib. Its standard designs are awesome and it also has a nice interface for working with pandas dataframes.

**Pandas Visualization**
Pandas is an open source high-performance, easy-to-use library providing data structures, such as dataframes, and data analysis tools like the visualization tools we will use in this article.
Pandas Visualization makes it really easy to create plots out of a pandas dataframe and series. It also has a higher level API than Matplotlib and therefore we need less code for the same results.
